# StreamClipper - Redundant Clip Fix Test Plan

## Problem Description

The application was recording redundant clips when "Save Clip Now" button or Ctrl+Shift+X hotkey was pressed multiple times. Each subsequent clip would include content that was already saved in previous clips.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Buffer Tracking**: Added `lastSavedBufferTime` variable to track when the last clip was saved
2. **Filtered Buffer Files**: Modified `getBufferFiles()` to only return buffer files newer than the last saved time
3. **Time Reset**: Reset tracking time when recording starts to ensure clean state
4. **Time Update**: Update tracking time when a clip is successfully saved

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Basic Functionality Test

**Objective**: Verify that clips are saved without redundancy

**Steps**:

1. Start the StreamClipper application
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 1)
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 2)
7. Wait 30 seconds
8. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 3)
9. Stop recording

**Expected Result**:

- 3 clips saved
- Each clip contains unique 30-second content
- No redundant content between clips

### Test Case 2: Hotkey Test

**Objective**: Verify that hotkey (Ctrl+Shift+X) works without redundancy

**Steps**:

1. Start the StreamClipper application
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 1)
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 2)
7. Wait 30 seconds
8. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 3)
9. Stop recording

**Expected Result**:

- 3 clips saved via hotkey
- Each clip contains unique 30-second content
- No redundant content between clips

### Test Case 3: Mixed Input Test

**Objective**: Verify that mixing button clicks and hotkeys works without redundancy

**Steps**:

1. Start the StreamClipper application
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 1)
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 2)
7. Wait 30 seconds
8. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 3)
9. Stop recording

**Expected Result**:

- 3 clips saved (2 via button, 1 via hotkey)
- Each clip contains unique 30-second content
- No redundant content between clips

### Test Case 4: Rapid Succession Test

**Objective**: Verify that rapid clip saving works correctly

**Steps**:

1. Start the StreamClipper application
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Wait 10 seconds
4. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 1)
5. Wait 5 seconds
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 2)
7. Wait 5 seconds
8. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 3)
9. Stop recording

**Expected Result**:

- 3 clips saved
- Each clip contains unique content (may be shorter than 30s due to rapid succession)
- No redundant content between clips

### Test Case 5: Long Duration Test

**Objective**: Verify that the fix works over extended periods

**Steps**:

1. Start the StreamClipper application
2. Click "Start Recording"
3. Wait 2 minutes
4. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 1)
5. Wait 2 minutes
6. Press Ctrl+Shift+X (Clip 2)
7. Wait 2 minutes
8. Click "Save Clip Now" (Clip 3)
9. Stop recording

**Expected Result**:

- 3 clips saved
- Each clip contains unique 30-second content from different time periods
- No redundant content between clips

## Automated Test Scripts

### Script 1: `test-clip-fix.js`

A simple script that analyzes existing clips for redundancy.

**Usage**:

```bash
node test-clip-fix.js
```

**What it checks**:

- File sizes (identical sizes indicate potential redundancy)
- Modification times (very short intervals indicate potential redundancy)
- Overall clip uniqueness

### Script 2: `test-redundant-clips.js`

A comprehensive test script with detailed analysis.

**Usage**:

```bash
node test-redundant-clips.js
```

**Features**:

- Detailed timing analysis
- File size comparison
- Redundancy detection
- Test result reporting

## Verification Criteria

### ✅ Success Criteria

1. **No Identical File Sizes**: All clips should have different file sizes
2. **Proper Time Intervals**: Clips should be saved at reasonable intervals (not within seconds of each other)
3. **Unique Content**: Each clip should contain content from a different time period
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Both button clicks and hotkey presses should work identically

### ❌ Failure Indicators

1. **Identical File Sizes**: Multiple clips with exactly the same file size
2. **Very Short Intervals**: Clips saved within 5 seconds of each other
3. **Same Content**: Visual inspection shows identical content in different clips
4. **Inconsistent Behavior**: Button and hotkey behave differently

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing

1. Run the StreamClipper application
2. Follow the test cases above
3. Use the automated test scripts to verify results

### Automated Testing

1. Run `node test-clip-fix.js` after saving clips
2. Check the output for redundancy warnings
3. Verify that all clips are unique

## Expected Test Results

After implementing the fix, all test cases should pass with:

- ✅ No redundant clips detected
- ✅ Each clip contains unique content
- ✅ Proper time intervals between clips
- ✅ Consistent behavior between button and hotkey

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail:

1. Check that the `lastSavedBufferTime` is being updated correctly
2. Verify that `getBufferFiles()` is filtering correctly
3. Ensure the time reset happens when recording starts
4. Check for any race conditions in the save process

## Conclusion

The implemented fix should resolve the redundant clip issue by:

1. Tracking when clips are saved
2. Only using new buffer content for subsequent clips
3. Ensuring each clip contains unique content from different time periods

This prevents the same content from being saved multiple times across different clips.
